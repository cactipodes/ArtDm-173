            <div>
                <p>For the purposes of this paper I will focus on the Peacock room and the various photographic representations of its interiors because of its well documented history.</p>
                <p>How have representations of this room changed over time?</p>
                <p>Is its representation stable or still changing?</p>
                <p>What does the room represent to its viewers?</p>
                <p>How does its representation effect its interpretation?</p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
                <p>The contract to design the dining room originally belonged to the Architect Thomas Jeckyll and was commissioned by Fredrick Leyland. Leyland ask for the room to be designed with “traditional European porcelain cabinets,” giving him ample room to display his collection. At some point during the project Jeckyll turned to Whistler for advice on the project, but Whistler had ideas of his own about what the room should look like. As time went on Jeckyll’s health was on the declined until he eventually went mad and died in an insane asylum leaving no one but Whistler to work on the project.

                <p>After Leyland’s death in 1892, the house goes up for sale, but no one buys the house until two years later. The new owner, Blanche Watney, doesn’t like the room. She find out it can be disassembled and decides to put the room up for sale.</p>

                <p>In 1904, Charles Freer, an admirer and friend of Whistler, buys the Peacock room. He has the room moved to Detroit and assembled in his mansion.</p>

                <p>Freer preferred ceramics and porcelains with different textures and different colors, unlike Leyland who preferred blue and white porcelains, and we can see that in the color photographs.</p>

                <p>In 2010 Wayne State University in conjunction with the Freer Gallery of Art, the Sackler Gallery, the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Asian Art and Wayne State University’s Library System published a website to make their content digital and available to the public. They made 3D renderings of the room as it looked prior to restoration, a room the way it looks with Leyland’s porcelain, and a room they way it looks with Freer’s ceramics.</p>

                <p>He recreated an art installation of the room entitled Filthy Lucre: Whistler's Peacock Room Reimagined. It plays with the ideas of beauty, excess and the grotesque. While Whistler worked on the room, there was a growing animosity between him and Leyland for not doing the job he asked him to do. This room is a continuation of that story. At the end, Whistler painted the peacocks fighting and now, as their fighting has continued, they eviscerate each other as the walls around them crack and melt.</p>
